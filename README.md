Too many people are using `taskkill /F` to shut down their DayZ Server, which can cause file corruption.
This script provides an alternative (better) "start.bat" to let the server shut down gracefully, as recommended in https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Server_Configuration

I recommend using `messages.xml` to restart the server, more information at https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Server_Messages
